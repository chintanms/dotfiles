Placing my Bash set-up files on GitHub.

Say you sync down all these files in ~ directory,
then you need to add following code to your .profile (or .bashrc)
to ensure eveything gets picked-up

<code>
  for file in ~/dotfiles/.{shopts,general,aliases,custom};
  do    
      if [ -f $file ] ;
      then
	  echo "Sourcing $file"
	  source $file
      fi
  done
</code>
